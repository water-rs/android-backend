# WaterUI Tutorial Book

Welcome to the complete guide for building cross-platform applications with WaterUI! This book will take you from a complete beginner to an advanced WaterUI developer, capable of building sophisticated applications that run on desktop, web, mobile, and embedded platforms.

## What is WaterUI?

WaterUI is a modern, declarative UI framework for Rust that enables you to build applications using a single codebase for multiple platforms. It combines the safety and performance of Rust with an intuitive, reactive programming model inspired by SwiftUI and React.

### Key Features

- **üöÄ Cross-Platform**: Write once, deploy everywhere - desktop, web, mobile, embedded
- **ü¶Ä Type-Safe**: Leverage Rust's powerful type system for compile-time correctness
- **‚ö° Reactive**: Automatic UI updates when data changes
- **üìù Declarative**: Describe what your UI should look like, not how to build it
### Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:

- **Basic Rust Knowledge**: Understanding of ownership, borrowing, traits, and generics
- **Programming Experience**: Familiarity with basic programming concepts
- **Command Line Comfort**: Ability to use terminal/command prompt

If you're new to Rust, we recommend reading [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) first.
